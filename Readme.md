# Introduction

This is a sample microservice to demonstrate how you can import a api-chassis-security project to incorporate authentication and authorization in your microservices using Auth0 as the authentication platform.

The library "api-chassis-security-auth0" uses a token-based authentication mechanism to validate the user identity and grant authorization.
